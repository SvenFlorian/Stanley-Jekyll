Stanley-Jekyll
----

This is my try at a Jekyll port of the free bootstrap theme Stanley, that [BlackTie.co](http://www.blacktie.co/) created.

All for free. In exchange, just give BlackTie.co credit for the design.

Dribbble shots used in this theme are from the awesome designer [David Creighton-Pester](https://dribbble.com/wanderingbert). I am unsure wether the license of his art is the same or not, please consult him if you want to use them.
