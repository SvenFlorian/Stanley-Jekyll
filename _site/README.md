Stanley-Jekyll
----

This is my try at a Jekyll port of the free bootstrap theme Stanley, that [BlackTie.co](http://www.blacktie.co/) created.

All for free. In exchange, just give BlackTie.co credit for the design.

Dribbble shots used in this theme are from the awesome designer [David Creighton-Pester](https://dribbble.com/wanderingbert). I am unsure wether the license of his art is the same or not, please consult him if you want to use them.

Usage
----

It is currently not a seamless experience to use this theme with GitHub Pages, despite the 'v1.0'-tag. GitHub Pages uses Jekyll version 1.5.1, whereas this project was developed for version 2.0.3 and newer. It is possible to host your site anyways, but it's a bit tedious effort required. 

1. Build the project locally with `jekyll build`
2. Delete all files from your master branch in *username.github.io*
3. Copy the all contents from the `_site`-folder to your master branch
4. Commit and push


I might look at a simpler solution further ahead (or use some kind of script for the deployment).
